# JediOrder REST API Documentation

Welcome to the **JediOrder REST API**! This API powers Chalmunâ€™s cantina on Tatooine, providing a platform for patrons to view, search, and rate dishes and drinks from across the galaxy. Chalmun thanks you for joining the guild of technologists to boost his sales and operational efficiency.

## Features

### Completed Work

#### AccountController Overview
**Key Features:**
- **Sign Up:**  
  Registers a new user account.
- **Sign In:**   
  Authenticates a user and generates a JWT token for secure access.

#### ProductsController Overview
**Key Features:**
- **Search Products:**  
  Retrieves products based on a search query or fetches all products if no query is provided.
- **Add a Product:**  
  Adds a new product entry (requires authentication).
- **Get Product Details:**   
  Retrieves detailed information for a specific product by ID.
- **Update a Product:**   
  Modifies an existing product.
- **Delete a Product:**   
  Removes a product by its ID.
- **Get Reviews for a Product:**  
  Retrieves all reviews for a specific product.
- **Add a Review for a Product:**  
  Allows users to add reviews (requires authentication).

#### Security and Functionality
- Implements user authentication for secure access across controllers.
- Supports complete management of accounts and products.

#### Performance Optimization
- **Async Patterns**: Uses asynchronous methods to handle concurrent requests, enhancing responsiveness.

## Future Work

### Pending Tasks
Since the API operates on legacy hardware, these performance improvements were implemented to handle increased load:
- **Caching**: In-memory caching for frequently accessed data reduces the need for repeated database queries.
- **Database Indexing**: Frequently queried fields are indexed to improve query speed and reduce database load.
- **Connection Pooling**: Connection pooling optimizes database connection management.
- **Response Compression**: Gzip compression is enabled for API responses to reduce payload size and improve network efficiency.

#### (Above and Beyond)
- **Review Management Dashboard**: Chalmun desires a dashboard to view and manage all reviews, providing insights into customer feedback and quality control.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate-limiting to prevent abuse from excessive review submissions.
- **OAuth2 SSO**: Enable user login with Google or other OAuth2 providers for added security and convenience.

### Additional Scalability Recommendations
For future scalability, should traffic exceed current optimizations:
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across multiple servers to enhance response times and reliability.
- **Database Sharding**: Split large datasets across multiple databases for optimized data retrieval.
- **Container Clustering**: Deploy the API on a Kubernetes or similar container cluster, enabling autoscaling and redundancy for seamless growth.

---

## Database

The **JediOrder API** operates within a containerized database environment:
- **docker-compose.yml**: Configures Docker Compose for streamlined deployment.
- **Migration Files**: Seed data is initialized through migrations to populate the database.

The **JediOrderDbContext** connects the API to the database, ensuring table creation and data seeding with logged error handling.

---

## Logging

Logging is currently configured to console output. For production, centralized logging is recommended to support better monitoring and diagnostics.

---

## Recommendations
For future scalability beyond current optimizations, consider:
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic to improve speed and reliability.
- **Database Sharding**: Divide large datasets for faster access.
- **Container Clustering**: Deploy on a Kubernetes cluster for autoscaling and fault tolerance.
